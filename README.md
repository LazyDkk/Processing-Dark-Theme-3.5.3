# Processing-Dark-Theme-3.5.3

The Orange Night - Processing Dark Mode Theme
==============================================

The Orange Night is a dark mode theme for the Processing IDE. The theme is made to be a little easier on the eyes with the more dark colors that it provides.

This theme was created for Processing 3.5.3 but it might work for other versions as well.

##Installation

It is adviced to take a backup of the original `theme.txt` file, `status` folder and `preferences.txt` file. This is if you're unhappy with the theme and wish to change back or if anything breaks. If these files are lost it is possibly to simply re-install the Processing IDE but do this at own risk.

Close Processing before replacing the old files or before making any changes to the files.

**Mac:**
* Theme.txt & Status: Go to `/Applications/Processing.app/Contents/Java/lib` and replace the `theme.txt` file and `status` folder with the once from the repository.
* Preferences.txt: Click on Processing > Preferences > Click on the link to the `preferences.txt` file in the bottom. This will redirect you to the folder where the `preferences.txt` file is stored. Now simply replace it with the one from the repository.

**Windows:**
Go to `/processing-3.5.3/modes/java/theme`
